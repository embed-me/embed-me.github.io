I am Lukas Lichtl, born in April 1990 in Linz, Austria. My lifelong fascination with the realms of electronics and software has shaped my professional journey. To this day, I remain deeply intrigued by the boundless possibilities that emerge when these two domains converge within a System-on-Chip (SoC).

My professional title reads as "Embedded Systems Engineer," a designation that encompasses a wide spectrum of responsibilities. In my case, my expertise spans from the development of graphic user interfaces to the creation of Embedded Linux distributions, extending all the way to FPGA development and the formulation of architectural specifications. Nevertheless, my primary area of specialization lies in FPGA and SoC development and consulting, which encompasses design evaluations and the implementation of automated build processes.

My previous project portfolio boasts an array of diverse applications, which include radar systems tailored for drone navigation, solutions designed for the automotive industry to support the development of autonomous vehicles, test frameworks for power electronics, as well as thermal imaging and video processing pipelines.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have recently transitioned into a leadership role, further enhancing my capabilities and responsibilities.
