## Intro

My name is Lukas Lichtl, I was born in April 1990 in Linz, Austria. Since I was a child, I have been captivated by electronics and software. Till today I am fascinated at what can be achieved when these two worlds interact. Combined in a chip (SoC), the range of applications for high-tech products is endless.

## What I do for living

My business card says Embedded Systems Engineer – that’s a broad field of activity and in my specific case, the expertise ranges from graphic user interface development, building Embedded Linux distributions all the way to FPGA development and definitions of architecture specifications. However, my main field of expertise is FPGA and SoC development and consulting that covers design reviews and build automation. Applications that I worked on include radar applications targeting drones, systems used in the automobile industry assisting in the development of self-driving cars, test frameworks for power electronics as well as thermal imaging and video processing pipelines.
